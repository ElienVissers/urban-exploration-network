    when you get an image, also get id from the prev and next image
    if there is a prev id, then show the prev button
    when the prev button is clicked,

2. add a text field where users can put tags when uploading
        when submitting, split on comma
        show the tags in the modal
        make them links --> show all images with this tag
        GO TO DAVID if you wanna do this, he'll give a tip about the db
